To run the CLRerNet lane detection project using the CULane dataset, 
you need Python 3.10 along with specific versions of MMDetection and its dependencies. 
The project requires MMDetection 3.0.0, MMCV 2.0.0, and MMEngine 0.7.4. 
It also depends on PyTorch 2.0.1 and TorchVision 0.15.2, preferably with CUDA 11.8 support. 
Additional libraries include NumPy, OpenCV, matplotlib, pycocotools, tqdm, Pillow, and PyYAML, among others. 
These packages ensure proper data loading, training, evaluation, and visualization. 
Optional tools like IPython, and pytest can assist in development and debugging. The setup is compatible with Ubuntu or Windows systems equipped with a CUDA-enabled GPU.
